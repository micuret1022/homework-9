1. What is SQL? What are relational databases?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used for managing and
manipulating relational databases. It allows users to query, update, and manage
data stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS). Relational databases
organize data into tables, where each table consists of rows and columns. The
relationships between tables are defined by keys, usually primary keys and foreign
keys, establishing connections between data points.


2. What is a PDO in PHP? Why do we need to use prepared statements?

PDO (PHP Data Objects) is a PHP extension that provides a consistent interface for
accessing databases in PHP. It allows developers to interact with various database
systems using a unified set of functions. Prepared statements in PDO are used for
executing SQL queries that contain parameters. These parameters are placeholders for
data values, and using prepared statements helps prevent SQL injection attacks by
separating SQL logic from the data being supplied. Prepared statements also offer
performance benefits by allowing the database to prepare the query once and execute
it multiple times with different parameters, reducing overhead.
